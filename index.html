            <h3>Early Life and Education</h3>
            <div class="bcontainer"></div>
            <p>Sushant Singh Rajput was born to Krishna Kumar Singh and Usha Singh in Patna, Bihar. His father retired
                as a
                technical official from the Bihar State Handloom Corporation in Patna. Gulshan, the youngest of five
                siblings, was his nickname. Mitu Singh, one of his four sisters, was a state-level cricketer.In Patna,
                he
                attended St. Karen's High School. Following his mother's death in 2002, Rajput's family relocated to
                Delhi,
                where he completed his intermediate studies at Kulachi Hansraj Model School.<br /><br />
                Rajput was a voracious reader who was fascinated by astrophysics and won the National Olympiad in
                Physics.
                He was admitted to the Delhi College of Engineering (later called Delhi Technological University) to
                study
                mechanical engineering for a Bachelor of Engineering degree. According to Rajput, he had no interest in
                engineering but his family forced him to, leaving him disappointed. Instead, he aspired to be an
                astronaut
                and, later, an air force pilot, but he was also interested in Bollywood, having a crush on Shah Rukh
                Khan.
            </p>
            <h3>Career</h3>
            <p>Sushant Singh Rajput has an illustrious career in the Indian cinema business, displaying his talent,
                versatility, and love of acting. He began his career in the entertainment industry as a television
                actor,
                becoming well known for his role in the TV series "Pavitra Rishta." His portrayal of the main character,
                Manav, struck a chord with the public, establishing him as a promising talent.<br /><br />

                In 2013, Sushant made his Bollywood debut with the film "Kai Po Che!" directed by Abhishek Kapoor. The
                movie
                was well-received, and his performance earned him critical acclaim and a Filmfare Award nomination for
                Best
                Male Debut. This marked the beginning of his successful transition from television to the big
                screen.<br /><br />

                Sushant Singh Rajput has starred in a variety of films of various genres over the years, demonstrating
                his
                flexibility as an actor. He played a variety of characters and took on difficult roles with conviction.
                "Shuddh Desi Romance" (2013), "PK" (2014), "M.S. Dhoni: The Untold Story" (2016), "Kedarnath" (2018),
                and
                "Chhichhore" (2019) are some of his significant films.<br /><br />

                One of his most acclaimed performances came in "M.S. Dhoni: The Untold Story," where he essayed the role
                of
                the legendary Indian cricketer Mahendra Singh Dhoni. Sushant's portrayal was widely praised for
                capturing
                the essence of Dhoni's persona and garnered him several awards and accolades.<br /><br />

                Apart from acting, Sushant was an avid learner and had a keen interest in various subjects, including
                astrophysics and technology. He often expressed his curiosity and love for learning. He actively pursued
                his
                interests, even enrolling in a course at the prestigious St. Xavier's College in Mumbai.<br /><br />

                It's important to remember and celebrate his contributions to cinema, acknowledging the talent and
                passion
                he brought to each role. Sushant's career serves as an inspiration for aspiring actors and reminds us of
                the
                transformative power of storytelling through the medium of film.</p>
            <h3>Personal Life</h3>
            <p>Sushant's personal life, particularly his relationships, has always been a hot topic among his fans and
                the
                media. He openly proposed to Ankita, his Pavitra Rishta co-star, and they began dating on the set of
                Pavitra
                Rishta. They were in the news again when they began living together in 2012, when they secretly married,
                but
                both parties denied it. Sushant announced in 2016 that they will marry in December, however they both
                ended
                their romance before that. Ankita revealed to the media in 2021 that Sushant wanted to pursue his career
                and
                that their relationship was over.<br /><br />

                Sushant was still in the news after his relationship ended due to his relationships with many actresses.
                When he first started working on Raabta in 2017, he was rumoured to be dating Kriti Sanon, however this
                was
                later proven to be a rumour and disputed by both actors. The next year, he was back in the news for his
                support of Padmavat producer Rajput Karni Saini.<br /><br />

                Later in 2018, Sushant was rumoured to be dating Saif Ali Khan's daughter and actress Sara Ali Khan;
                they
                both neither accepted nor denied this and remained apart, however in 2019, Sushant was said to be seen
                with
                Rhea Chakraborty (famous Bollywood actress). Rhea agreed that they were dating after his death, and
                Sushant
                was unwilling to take anti-depression medicines since he believed Yoga. Sushant was planned to marry in
                2021, according to his father, but he didn't notify him about the bride.<br /><br />

                Aside from his love life, while filming "Chanda Mama Door Ke," Shushant, who already had an interest in
                Astronomy and Astrophysics, began reading literature on the subject and accumulated a collection of 125
                volumes on Physics. He purchased numerous additional books because he was an avid reader who was also
                interested in Cognitive Science and Behavioural Economics.</p>

            <h1>Social Impact and initiatives</h1>
            <div>
                <p class="text">The ‘Kai Po Che’ actor believes in ‘Right to Education’ and thus, plans to provide free
                    education for the
                    underprivileged and doing his bit for education and student welfare.
                    Sushant told IANS about the initiative: “My team is working on the idea where we are selecting a
                    group of
                    schools, and we will take a merit test of the kids. If the kids pass the exam, we will take care of
                    their
                    education cost for a year. Next year, they again have to sit for the test to get the free education.
                    This is
                    the first step and will work on other models. But I think this process will give kids a new
                    excitement and
                    encouragement to study and make them more competitive.”<br />The actor also spoke about the
                    importance of
                    education: “My mother always taught me that we educate our children not to become a doctor or
                    engineer, but
                    the impact of basic education reflects on their thought process and decision making. So even if you
                    are
                    getting into a creative profession like acting, your basic education will open your mind enough to
                    think
                    analytically.Therefore, I have taken this small step towards providing basic education to deserving
                    children.”</p>
